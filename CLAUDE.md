# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chrome Extension project for AI-powered voice dictation using Groq API. The extension allows users to dictate text using voice commands, which are then transcribed and intelligently formatted based on the context of the application being used.

## Architecture

The extension follows Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture with the following key components:

- **background.js**: Service worker that manages audio recording via offscreen document, API communication with Groq (Whisper for transcription, LLM for formatting), and message passing
- **offscreen.html/js**: Offscreen document that handles actual audio recording using MediaRecorder API (required since service workers can't access getUserMedia)
- **content.js**: Content script injected into web pages that detects text input fields (including Google search), shows recording UI, and inserts formatted text
- **popup.html/js**: Extension popup interface for quick access to dictation functionality
- **config.html/js**: Settings page for API key configuration, model selection, custom model path support, and custom system prompt configuration

## Development Commands

This is a static Chrome extension project with no build process required. To develop:

1. **Load extension in Chrome**:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory

2. **Test the extension**:
   - Click in any text field on a webpage
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+1 or click the extension icon
   - Speak clearly and press Enter/Esc to stop recording

3. **Package for distribution**:
   ```bash
   zip -r voice-dictation-extension.zip manifest.json background.js offscreen.html offscreen.js content.js popup.html popup.js config.html config.js styles.css translations.js _locales -x ".*" -x "__MACOSX" -x "*.md"
   ```

## Project Structure

- `manifest.json` - Chrome extension manifest (v3) with offscreen permission and locale support
- `background.js` - Service worker managing offscreen document and API calls
- `offscreen.html/js` - Offscreen document for audio recording via MediaRecorder
- `content.js` - Content script for UI and text insertion (supports Google search) with multilingual support
- `popup.html/js` - Extension popup interface with dynamic language switching
- `config.html/js` - Settings page with custom model path, system prompt support, and language selector
- `styles.css` - Shared styles for popup and config pages
- `translations.js` - Centralized translation system for English and German
- `_locales/` - Chrome locale files for extension name/description (en, de)
- `voice-dictation-extension.zip` - Packaged extension ready for distribution

## Key Implementation Details

- **API Integration**: Uses Groq API with Whisper Large V3 Turbo for transcription and configurable LLM models for text formatting
- **JSON Response Format**: LLM now returns structured JSON responses for consistent output parsing
- **Custom Models**: Supports both predefined models (including Qwen QWQ 32B) and custom model paths for future Groq model compatibility
- **Custom System Prompts**: Fully customizable AI instructions with reset to default functionality
- **Enhanced System Prompt**: Prevents AI from interpreting dictated text as commands - treats all input as content to be formatted
- **Offscreen Document**: Uses Chrome's offscreen API to handle audio recording in service worker context
- **Context-Aware Formatting**: Detects the current website/app and adjusts writing style accordingly (e.g., formal for Gmail, casual for Slack, works on Google.com)
- **Chrome Storage Sync**: Settings automatically sync across devices using `chrome.storage.sync`
- **Multilingual Support**: Full German and English language support with automatic language detection and synced preferences
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Default is Ctrl+Shift+1, configurable via chrome://extensions/shortcuts - now with automatic content script injection
- **Extended Token Support**: Increased max tokens from 500 to 6000 for longer dictations
- **Force Mode**: New toggle that allows dictation anywhere, with clipboard fallback when no text field is available
- **Enhanced Recording**: 60-second recording duration with countdown warning in the last 10 seconds
- **Always-Visible Debug Button**: Debug logs are now accessible via a permanent button in the popup (no triple-click needed)

## Testing Approach

Manual testing is required for Chrome extensions:
1. Test microphone permissions handling via offscreen document
2. Verify text insertion works across different input types (input, textarea, contenteditable, role="combobox")
3. Test on various websites including Google.com search to ensure context detection works properly
4. Verify API error handling and fallback behavior
5. Test custom model path functionality
6. Test custom system prompt configuration and reset functionality
7. Test JSON response parsing with command-like dictations (e.g., "Can you help me schedule a meeting?")
8. Test with Qwen QWQ 32B model option
9. Verify longer dictations work with increased token limit
10. Test language switching between English and German
11. Verify all UI elements update correctly when switching languages
12. Ensure language preference syncs across devices
